# Some notes about setting up my new macbook

I'm going to go over all of the Mac setup for a course... just keeping notes.

* Open book
  * follow prompts (I turned off Siri)
    * generally - you have to log in to the computer...
  * note how you have to 'log in' - and how there can be many "Users"
  * turns on when you open it... sleeps when you close it...

* Take stock of what is there
  * screen
  * keys
    * combinations of keys
  * trackpad / (mouse) - note that history...
  * weird touch bar
  * what's on the sides? Connectors etc.
    * usb / usb 2 3 c etc... ports
    * head phones...

* What's that 'top bar' called
  * Reference what we talked about with the top down/left to right type of informational setup - and how that relates to the main menus

* Note the 'dock' (I'll remove that later)

* Start walking through the main menu options
  * **Apple**
    * About this Mac
      * Note preferences - and then note the 'overview' style of research - and that we'll stay at a high level for now
      * Skip recent
      * Talk about restart/shutdown logout etc.
      
  * Talk about the "**Finder**" / note 'windows' - and talk a bit about "Graphical User Interfaces" - put in some examples / DOS etc.
    * "about finder" - isn't very useful... haha - is it an "application" ???
    * I've never used 'services'
    * note preferences
  
  * Finder finds "**file**s" / but we didn't cover that yet... - how can we prepare for that first? - 

    * note the 'get info' - what is it getting info for in this case... What is "desktop" technically... just a folder with a visual layout unique to the finder?
    * should we talk about that before or later?
  
  * "**Edit**" UH... what does this help us with here...

  * "**View**" has to do with the layout / and visual feel of the applications (and we should note that most of these menu item names are common throughout most applications

  * "**Go**" - I don't use this much... but I do use it to get to library sometimes... - maybe talk about control or something... 

  * "**Window**"

  * "**Help**" - you can search for stuff

*
